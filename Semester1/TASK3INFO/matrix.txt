Hi,

thanks for being so quick to test it, the directory with the math 
headers was indeed missing in the archive!

We have uploaded a new version of the rtg.zip, please find it in the 
TeachCenter.

The possible includes are:

#include <math/math.h>
#include <math/vector.h>
#include <math/Matrix.h>

Here you have a little example that you can try out in the main function 
to see if everything works and to get acquainted with the math functions:

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
     math::float3 vector(3, 4, 5);

     std::cout << vector << "\n" << std::endl;

     math::float4x4 matrix = math::identity<math::float4x4>();

     std::cout << matrix << "\n" << std::endl;

     matrix._11 = 5;
     matrix._12 = 5;
     matrix._13 = 5;

     std::cout << matrix << std::endl;
...
}

Best regards, Bernhard.
