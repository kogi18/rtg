Simple 3D object (colored faces for clear understanding) = piramids sticking together
Use buffer objects and array
VerSha: maps the object to the screen according to a given model, view and projection
VerSha: outputs normals vectors for shading to the fragment shader
VerSha: use uniform variables to pass info like matrices for the shader
FragSha: implement simple lambertian shading
FragSha: light comes from a point light source located at the position of the camera
Set up a camera looking at the object with view and projection matrix
Use the model matrix to spin the object
Draw the object
